# Contributing

Contributions and pull requests are welcome, but we ask the following guidelines are respected;

+ the PR adds a compelling new feature 
+ OR addresses a known / open issue
+ OR improves reliability / robustness
+ adhere to current coding style used within the source - good comments, tab indents etc.
+ be hygenic, ensure all secondary tasks are done - robustness checks, update summary, readme, installer etc.
+ don't update version num - will be incremented when the PR is merged
